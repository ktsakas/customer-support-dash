* Stats: at the top of the dashboard there is data on the customer (Name, # of Tickets and Avg Days to Resolve Ticket).
* Status bar graph / Status pie chart:
    - Note: the status field is not available in Rally it is produced as a combination of L3KanbanStage and Project Name.
    - Click on one of the bars or pie pieces to filter the tickets table by status.
* Projects panel: click on a project to filter the tickets.
    - iHotelier includes all tickets under "Reservations" or "Reservations"
    - Note: ideally we would like to filter by product, however there is no good way to map products to Rally projecs so we only provide these two options.
* Regions panel: click on one or multiple regions to filter the tickets.
* Tickets table:
    - Tickets can be filtered based on user selections in any of the panels and are listed at the bottom of the page.
    - Functionality: sort by a specific column or export to csv.
